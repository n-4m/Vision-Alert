Flutter Object Detection App
📖 Project Description
A Flutter application integrating object detection with real-time user guidance and image capture. This app leverages advanced tools like TensorFlow Lite and YOLOv8 for accurate object detection, while ensuring smooth functionality with state-of-the-art frameworks and responsive UI components.

🔑 Key Features
Dynamic Object Marker Placement

Real-time placement of visual markers on detected objects.
Markers adjust dynamically based on camera frames.
Object Detection (YOLOv8)

Integrated YOLOv8 with TensorFlow Lite for on-device object detection in real-time.
Capable of recognizing a wide range of objects in various environments.
Photo Management

Capture photos when the detection confidence exceeds 0.7.
Display captured photos on a separate screen with complete metadata, including:
Object Type
Confidence Level
Date
Timestamp
Architecture

Clean project structure using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern for maintainable and scalable development.
